## Night Sky

This project was made to train my canvas animation skills.
Tried to make a starry night with some interaction.
I'm quite happy with functionality od the script.
There are few things I'm looking forward to improve such as:
- colors 
- numbers of stars on different screen sizes

I'm going to make more animations, canvas is really powerful!
